Things that need to be done / bugs that should be fixed:

BUGS:

- Something broke all the dialog boxes
- xterm? bug in Screen.cc, saved background color problem
- segfault on unrecognignized config option?
- #<x> will add the commands at the end of the command list rather than the
  beginning
- exit does not correctly clear titlebar on kvt
- $prefix in configure is not respected (should use $prefix/lib/mcl instead
  of the hardcoded /usr/[local]/lib/mcl
- speedwalk_character is removed if a speedwalk is invalid
- \ will not escape #commands


HIGH PRIORITY: (I'd like to do this myself one day)
+ Make #macro usable online
+ Full blown telnet client with VT100 etc. emulation -- and scrollback
+ Make mcl understand SIGWINCH (tough for scrollback!)

+ URLGET module: watch for URLs shown in text. URLGET 1 launches a program
  for the last seen URL (e.g. netscape)

+ AutoLearn feature: when telnetting to a new MUD, e.g. foobar.org 4242,
  allow to create and add a new MUD to the config file with that setup,
  including e.g. first 10 things sent to the MUD so you can put in
  character name/password 

+ X support. fte does this nicely, I should probably just take the X11 support
  from there and hack it up. I have no clue about X otherwise.

+ #emit command to emit any keypress

+ Control-R just like in readline!

+ Rewrite lots of the windowing system, there is a lot of junk floating around

+ Support long options via getopt_long

+ Grouping of aliases/actions/macros and disabling of them group-by-group.

+ Multiline aliases e.g.

Alias foo {
	say Hello!
	say How are you?
}

+ Split scrollback/output window (so you can scroll back while still looking
  at current output)

MEDIUM PRIORITY: (Probably)

+ Slow replay of commands

+ Add the hashtable code and replace the failed list with a hashtable

+ Color prompt

+ Stable pattern matching so the matches don't kick in until the whole
  line is done.

LOW PRIORITY: (Doubtful)

+ Dialog boxes for configuration.

+ Full customization of keyboard commands

+ Multiple sessions (unlikely, just run it on two VCs)

+ The perl functions relay on global variables for passing arguments
  back and forth (e.g. keypress uses $Key). This is not good.

Unprioritized wishlist from users:

Forward/backwards a word
Add timestamp to scrollback
Learn Keys feature like in Midnight Commander
Read in file, send to MUD.
Actions that trigger raw
Support underline (in slow mode only?)
